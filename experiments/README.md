# Experiments and prototypes

This directory contains experiments that helped us along the path to implementing the data definition language as it stands today.
While we ultimately ran into limiting issues on many of them, we've preserved them to show you how we arrived at where we are today.
Perhaps you might find them useful!

In rough chronological order:

1.  [mercury-prototype](./mercury-prototype) (@mikeday)
2.  [rust-prototype-v1](./rust-prototype-v1) (@brendanzab)
3.  [lean](./lean) (@brendanzab)
4.  [prolog-prototype](./prolog-prototype) (@markbrown)
5.  [rust-prototype-v2](./rust-prototype-v2) (@brendanzab)

The following repositories also provided us with valuable experience along the way:
